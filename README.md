# SNS to Slack

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function to send [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) notifications to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel. Tries to format messages as well as it can.

Based on [a gist by Joseph Terranova](https://gist.github.com/terranware/962da63ca547f55667f6).

## Usage

Instructions coming soon.

## TODO

- Fill out this README more!
- Add additional unit tests
- Nicely format form data being sent through as the message
- Handle nice formats for more AWS services
- Handle base64 data, such as that coming from AWS SES e-mails
